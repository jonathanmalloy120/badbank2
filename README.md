   <h3>Hopes and Dreams</h3>
  <h5> As you can likely tell, I am a beginner in the world of 3-tier applications. However, I think it is useful to share work so other beginners can see it and understand how other beginners are approaching basic projects such as this one. The ultimate goal is to figure out how to emulate all the functionality of the original BadBank, which was working quite well<h5>
